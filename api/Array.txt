arr.splice

arr.diff(other);
	@param other The other array to compare with.
	Compare two arrays and return a list of items in `arr` that are not inside of `other`.

arr.intersect(other);
	@param other The other array to compare with.
	Compare two arrays and return a list of items inside of both arrays.

arr.unique();
	@debate Should this modify instead of returning a copy? Which is more common, reasonable?
	Return a copy of `arr` with all duplicates removed.

arr.flat();
	@TBD Should this be flattened, flaten?
	Flatten an array of arrays down to a single level array and return it.
	-- Example

	['foo', 'bar', 'bing', 'bang', 'baz']
