@module io
@class FileArray

fl.cat();
	Returns the contents of all the files in the list concatenated together.

fl.remove();
	Delete all the files in the file list.

fl.touch();
	Touch all the files in the list so that they all have updated timestamps.

fl.rename(regex, replacement);
	Rename all the files inside of the file list based on a pattern. .rename()
	is similar to string.replace(), the regex is like a `regex` pattern to .replace()
	and `replacement` the string replacement for that pattern.
	-- Example
	// Rename all .htm files in the current working directory to end with .html
	Directory('.').glob('*.htm').rename(/.htm$/, '.html');
