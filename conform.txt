This document is here to outline the details of a conforming implementation of
a monkeyscript environment.

A conforming implementation should build a `monkeyscript` or `monkeyscript.exe` (on MSWIN)
binary. Considerations should be made that this is not the only environment that
monkeyscript should be implemented in; An Apache mod_monkeyscript is planned
for the near future after the initial coding of the project is stable, and monkeyscript
should be available to be embedded into another program. Thus the source for the
main binary should put the monkeyscript environment portions in a common area and the
binary source should focus on the actual loading and execution of the environment
from it's pov.

MonkeyScript's target platform is SpiderMonkey 1.8+, the spidermonkey for MonkeyScript
should be built with the same options defined in JS_VERSION = 180 with the exception
that JS_HAS_STR_HTML_HELPERS should be disabled. (JS_HAS_SCRIPT_OBJECT is a discussion point)

A few additional requirements over the normal JavaScript requirements are made:
* A read-only property global should be defined in the global scope refering to the global object (like window).
* undefined, NaN, and Infinite should be made read only. (see jslibs for implementation hints)
* A _native property should be defined in the global scope,
